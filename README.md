# DISCLAIMER

I know this app isn't very secure. I only created it to brush up on the use of SharedPreferences in Android. I put it on GitHub in hopes that it may help someone else brush up on SharedPreferences. I made it really quick soley for practice. It does not have any encryption whatsoever. 

In reality, a rooted device can easy gain access to SharedPreferences. Also it is not reccommended to use setContentView multiple times, but rather a ViewFlipper.
